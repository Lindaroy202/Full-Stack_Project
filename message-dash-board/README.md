# Folder structure and preparation
There are 2 folders:

/client - this contains the create-react-app built React frontend

This will run on port 3000
/server - this contains the backend code

This will run on port 3001

#Backend
The backend is stored in the /server folder

The purpose of these tasks is to create a REST API which will serve the frontend

This REST API will do the following:

allow users to view all posts
allow users to view a single post
allow users to register
allow users to login
allow users to create a new post
allow users to edit a their previous posts
allow users to delete previous posts
All users will be allowed to post content, but users can only modify or delete posts which they have created

The REST API will use authentication and authorisation to validate users. You will be expected to implement this.

#Frontend
For the frontend, it is largely up to you how present the information to the user. You should be thinking in terms of "what features would my users want?"
